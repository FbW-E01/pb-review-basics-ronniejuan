// # Review 1 - basics

// NOTE! Pay close attention to creating code with good and consistent code style.

// 1. Make a variable and assign an even number to that variable. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

const even = 2;

// 2. Make a variable and assign a negative odd number to that variable. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

const negativeOdd = -3;

// 3. Make a variable and assign a string to that variable using double quotes. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

const str = "Duble Cheese";

// 4. Make a variable and assign a string to that variable using single quotes. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

const singleStr = 'queso';

// 5. Make a variable and assign a string to that variable using a template literal. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

const template = "hello";
console.log(`Hans says ${template}.`)

// 6. Make a variable and assign an empty string to that variable using a template literal. Make sure that variable *can* be changed.

let smth = " ";
console.log(`hola me llamo ${smth}`);

// 7. Make a variable and assign a boolean to that variable using a template literal. Make sure that variable *can* be changed.
// 8. Make a variable and assign a boolean to that variable using a template literal. Make sure that variable can not be changed.
// 9. Print the `type` of a variable that has a number value.

const numb = 9;
console.log(typeof(numb))

// 10. Print the `type` of a variable that has a string value.

const stra = "Duble Cheese";
console.log(typeof(stra))

// 11. Print the `type` of a variable that has a boolean value. -->

const dam = false;
console.log(typeof(dam))
